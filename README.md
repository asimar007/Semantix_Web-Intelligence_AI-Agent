## About

Semanix is a full-stack AI application designed to bridge the gap between static web content and intelligent, searchable knowledge. The platform allows users to input any website URL, automatically extracts and processes the content, and creates an interactive chat interface where users can ask questions about the website's content in natural language.

The application is perfect for developers, researchers, content analysts, and anyone who needs to quickly extract insights from websites efficiently. By combining advanced web scraping techniques with AI-powered semantic search, Semantix transforms how we interact with web content.

- Understanding vector databases and semantic search principles

- Implementing efficient text chunking strategies for large content

### **Full-Stack Architecture**

- Next.js App Router patterns for organizing API routes and pages

- Managing complex state between frontend and backend services

- Error handling and timeout management for AI operations

### **Web Scraping Techniques**

- Combining static (Cheerio) and dynamic (Puppeteer) scraping approaches

- Content extraction and cleaning strategies

- Handling different website structures and content types

### **Performance Optimization**

- Implementing rate limiting and batch processing

- Vector database optimization strategies

- Memory management for large text processing

## Usage

1.  **Enter a URL**: Input any website URL in the URL input field

2.  **Processing**: Watch as the system scrapes, processes, and embeds the content

3.  **Chat**: Once processing is complete, start asking questions about the website content

4.  **Explore**: Use natural language to explore and discover insights from the processed content

The platform automatically handles content extraction, chunking, embedding generation, and vector storage, providing a seamless experience for users to interact with web content intelligently.
